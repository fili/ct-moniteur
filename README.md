## Installation

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CERT-Polska/ct-moniteur
```

Or clone and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CERT-Polska/ct-moniteur
cd ct-moniteur
pip install .
```

## Command-Line Tool

The library includes a simple `ct-moniteur` command-line demo tool.

### Basic Usage

Monitor all CT logs and print domains to console:

```bash
ct-moniteur
```

Output:
```
[2025-10-05T14:23:45.123456] https://ct.googleapis.com/logs/argon2024 - [example.com, www.example.com]
[2025-10-05T14:23:45.234567] https://oak.ct.letsencrypt.org/2024h1 - [test.org]
```

### Domains Only

Output only domain names (one per line) for easy processing with bash tools:

```bash
ct-moniteur --domains-only
```

Output:
```
example.com
www.example.com
test.org
mail.test.org
```

### JSON Output

Output certificates in JSON format:

```bash
ct-moniteur --json
```

Output:
```json
{"timestamp": 1728137025123, "entry_type": "X509LogEntry", "source": {"index": 12345, "log": {"url": "https://ct.googleapis.com/logs/argon2024", "name": "Argon 2024", "operator": "Google"}}, "domains": ["example.com", "www.example.com"], "subject": "CN=example.com", "issuer": "CN=Let's Encrypt", ...}
```

### Verbose Logging

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
ct-moniteur --verbose
```

### CLI Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--domains-only` | Output only domain names |
| `--json` | Format output as JSON |
| `--verbose` | Display debug logging |

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage - Print All Domains

```python
import asyncio
from ct_moniteur import CTMoniteur

def process_certificate(entry):
    """Process each certificate entry"""
    print(entry.domains)

async def main():
    # Create monitor
    monitor = CTMoniteur(callback=process_certificate)
    
    try:
        # Start monitoring from current position
        await monitor.start()
        
        # Run indefinitely (or until Ctrl+C)
        await asyncio.Event().wait()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nShutting down...")
    finally:
        await monitor.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## State Persistence Example

The library supports full state persistence, allowing you to resume monitoring from where you left off after restarts.

```python
import asyncio
import json
from pathlib import Path
from ct_moniteur import CTMoniteur

STATE_FILE = Path("ct_state.json")
SAVE_INTERVAL = 60  # Save state every 60 seconds

def load_state():
    """Load previous state from disk"""
    if STATE_FILE.exists():
        with open(STATE_FILE) as f:
            state = json.load(f)
        print(f"Loaded state with {len(state)} logs")
        return state
    return None

def save_state(monitor):
    """Save current state to disk"""
    state = monitor.get_state()
    with open(STATE_FILE, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(state, f, indent=2)
    print(f"State saved ({len(state)} logs tracked)")

def process_certificate(entry):
    """Process each certificate entry"""
    # Print all domains
    print(f"[{entry.source.log.name}] {', '.join(entry.domains)}")
    
    # Example: Filter for specific domains
    if any(domain.endswith('.example.com') for domain in entry.domains):
        print(f"  -> Found example.com certificate!")

async def main():
    # Load previous state (or start from current position if no state exists)
    initial_state = load_state()
    
    # Create monitor with state
    monitor = CTMoniteur(
        callback=process_certificate,
        initial_state=initial_state
    )
    
    try:
        # Start monitoring
        await monitor.start()
        
        # Periodically save state
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(SAVE_INTERVAL)
            save_state(monitor)
            
            # Print statistics
            stats = monitor.get_stats()
            print(f"Total entries processed: {stats.total_entries_processed}")
            print(f"Active logs: {stats.active_logs}")
            
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nShutting down...")
    finally:
        # Save final state before exiting
        save_state(monitor)
        await monitor.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Sharding and Filtering

### Log Filtering

Include or exclude specific logs by URL patterns:

```python
# Only monitor Google logs
monitor = CTMoniteur(
    callback=process_certificate,
    include_logs=["googleapis.com"]
)

# Exclude Let's Encrypt logs
monitor = CTMoniteur(
    callback=process_certificate,
    exclude_logs=["letsencrypt.org"]
)

# Combine both
monitor = CTMoniteur(
    callback=process_certificate,
    include_logs=["googleapis.com", "cloudflare"],
    exclude_logs=["argon2025"]
)
```

### Distributed Processing with Sharding

Automatically distribute logs across multiple instances using hash-based sharding:

```python
# Instance 0 of 4
monitor = CTMoniteur(
    callback=process_certificate,
    shard_id=0,
    total_shards=4
)

# Instance 1 of 4
monitor = CTMoniteur(
    callback=process_certificate,
    shard_id=1,
    total_shards=4
)
```

Each log URL is assigned to a shard using `hash(url) % total_shards`. Benefits:
- New logs automatically assigned to a shard
- Even distribution without manual configuration
- Scale by increasing `total_shards` and adding instances

### Connection Pool Tuning

Adjust connection limits for high-throughput scenarios:

```python
monitor = CTMoniteur(
    callback=process_certificate,
    max_connections=200,           # Total connections
    max_keepalive_connections=50   # Persistent connections
)
```

## API Reference

### CTMoniteur

Main class for monitoring all CT logs.

**Constructor:**
```python
CTMoniteur(
    callback: Callable,              # Function to process each entry (sync or async)
    initial_state: Dict[str, int],   # Optional: {log_url: last_index}
    skip_retired: bool = True,       # Skip retired logs
    poll_interval: float = 15.0,     # Polling interval in seconds
    timeout: float = 30.0,           # HTTP timeout
    user_agent: str = None,          # Custom user agent
    max_retries: int = 3,            # Max retries per log
    retry_delay: float = 10.0,       # Delay between retries
    refresh_interval: float = 6.0,   # Log list refresh interval in hours (0 to disable)
    max_connections: int = 100,      # HTTP connection pool size
    max_keepalive_connections: int = 20,  # Keepalive connections
    include_logs: List[str] = None,  # Only include logs matching patterns
    exclude_logs: List[str] = None,  # Exclude logs matching patterns
    shard_id: int = None,            # Shard ID for distributed processing
    total_shards: int = None,        # Total number of shards
)
```

**Methods:**
- `start()` - Start monitoring all logs
- `stop()` - Stop monitoring gracefully
- `get_state()` - Get current state (dict of log_url -> index)
- `get_stats()` - Get monitoring statistics

### CertificateEntry

Each certificate entry contains:

- `timestamp` - Certificate timestamp
- `entry_type` - "X509LogEntry" or "PrecertLogEntry"
- `certificate` - Raw X.509 certificate object
- `source` - EntrySource object containing:
  - `index` - Entry index in the log
  - `log` - LogMeta object with:
    - `url` - Source CT log URL
    - `name` - Source CT log name
    - `operator` - Log operator name
- `domains` - List of domains (CN + SANs)
- `subject` - Certificate subject
- `issuer` - Certificate issuer
- `not_before` - Valid from datetime
- `not_after` - Valid until datetime
- `serial_number` - Certificate serial number (hex)
- `fingerprint_sha256` - SHA-256 fingerprint
- `fingerprint_sha1` - SHA-1 fingerprint

### MonitorStats

Statistics tracked during monitoring:

- `total_entries_processed` - Total number of certificates processed
- `entries_per_log` - Dictionary of entries processed per log
- `errors_per_log` - Dictionary of errors encountered per log
- `active_logs` - Number of logs being monitored
- `start_time` - Monitoring start time

## State File Format

The state is a simple JSON dictionary:

```json
{
  "https://ct.googleapis.com/logs/argon2024": 12345678,
  "https://oak.ct.letsencrypt.org/2024h1": 87654321,
  ...
}
```

Each key is a log URL, and the value is the last processed index.

## Performance Considerations

- The library monitors dozens of logs concurrently using asyncio
- Use async callbacks for I/O operations (database, API calls)
- Save state periodically (every 30-60 seconds) to avoid data loss
- Consider filtering certificates in the callback to reduce processing load
- Logs are polled with staggered delays to avoid request bursts
